# PDFMerger

In today’s digital world, data privacy is more important than ever. The moment you upload a file to the internet, you lose control over how it’s handled or who can access it. That’s why it’s crucial to protect your personal and confidential information.

I'm excited to share a simple tool I originally built for personal use — and I hope it benefits you as well.
It’s a lightweight PDF merger developed using JavaScript and HTML, allowing users to securely combine PDF files directly in their browser. There are no uploads and no server-side processing — everything runs locally on your device, ensuring your files remain private and completely under your control.

Whether you’re organizing documents or merging multiple PDFs into a single file, this tool is fast, user-friendly, and privacy-focused.
